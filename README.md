# 🐾 9 Lives: Where Code Cats Hunt Algorithms in the Dark

*"You have 9 lives to master coding... don't waste them on stack overflow errors."*


## 🦇 Welcome to the Purrgatury of Programming

In the deepest corners of the internet, where syntax errors go to die and infinite loops echo through eternity, lies **9 Lives**—a coding platform so addictive, it should come with a warning label.

Here, learning DSA isn't just education—it's survival. You're not just a programmer; you're a digital predator stalking bugs in the shadows, collecting fish like trophies, and leaving a trail of solved algorithms in your wake.

*"In Soviet Russia, code debugs you. In 9 Lives, you are the bug."* 🕷️

## 🎭 **Parting Words from the Abyss**

*"In a world full of light themes, be the dark mode."*

**9 Lives** isn't just a platform—it's a digital purgatory where good programmers go to become great ones, and great programmers go to question their life choices. We've built a place where algorithms fear to compile and semicolons go to die.

Whether you're a code kitten still learning to meow or a seasoned predator ready to pounce on FAANG interviews, remember: you have 9 lives to get it right. Use them wisely.

**Remember: Every bug you squash brings you one fish closer to digital immortality.**

*Now go forth and code like the magnificent, coffee-fueled, cat-loving developer you were born to be.*

---

*⭐ Star this repository if it made you purr with delight (or cry with despair—we accept both)*

**May your code be bug-free and your fish bowl always full! 🐱‍💻🐟**

---

*P.S. - No actual cats were harmed in the making of this platform. The same cannot be said for the developers' sleep schedules.*
